#### Introduction

My name is Emanuel Matias D'Urso, a **Solution Architect** and **Software Engineer** passionate about the intersection of low-level systems programming and enterprise architecture.

While I currently work as a **Manager at Accenture** specializing in enterprise platforms, my heart lies in systems programming, game engine development, and pushing hardware to its limits. I believe the best software engineers understand the full stack—from CPU cache lines and memory alignment to distributed cloud architectures.

#### Philosophy

> "The closer to the hardware, the more I enjoy the work."

I started with game development and low-level programming, building game engines with Vulkan and C++. This foundation taught me about performance optimization, memory management, and hardware constraints—skills that translate to building better enterprise systems.

#### Current Work

By day, I'm a **Manager at Accenture** (since November 2024), leading the Iberia SAP CX area. I apply architectural thinking and performance optimization principles from systems programming to enterprise solutions.

By night, I work on [**Another Dunkan Engine**](https://github.com/Dunkansdk/another-dunkan-engine)—a Vulkan-based game engine featuring:
- Custom ECS (Entity Component System)
- Deferred rendering with PBR (Physically Based Rendering)
- SSAO (Screen Space Ambient Occlusion)
- Modern C++20 architecture

#### Technical Journey

My programming journey started with **Visual Basic 6** modding **Argentum Online** (a 2D MMORPG), where I learned about networking, game loops, and real-time systems. This led me to:

- **C/C++ systems programming** - Building game engines, understanding memory layouts
- **Vulkan graphics API** - Low-level GPU programming, render pipelines
- **Assembly** - Reverse engineering and understanding how code really works
- **Enterprise architecture** - Applying performance principles at scale

#### Core Expertise

**Systems & Game Development:**
- C/C++ (Modern C++20), Vulkan API, OpenGL
- Game engine architecture, ECS patterns
- Graphics programming, shader development (GLSL)
- Visual Basic 6 (legacy game modding)
- Performance optimization, profiling

**Enterprise Architecture:**
- SAP Commerce Cloud, SAP BTP, S/4HANA
- Java, Spring Boot, Microservices
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure)
- AI/GenAI integration

#### Education

- **SAP Certified Associate** - Business User, SAP
- **Técnico Superior en Programación** - Universidad Tecnológica Nacional (2016-2018)
- **Self-taught** - Graphics programming, systems architecture, game engine development
