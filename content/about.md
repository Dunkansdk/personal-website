#### Introduction

My name is Emanuel Matias D'Urso, a **Solution Architect** and **Software Engineer** passionate about the intersection of low-level systems programming and enterprise architecture.

While I currently work as a **Manager at Accenture** specializing in enterprise platforms, my heart lies in systems programming, game engine development, and pushing hardware to its limits. I believe the best software engineers understand the full stack—from CPU cache lines and memory alignment to distributed cloud architectures.

#### Philosophy

```
I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is
cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...
                Or feels threatened by me...
                Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
                Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
        Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.

This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and
you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek
after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color,
without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us
and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me
for.
```

#### Current Work

By day, I'm a **Manager at Accenture** (since November 2024), leading the Iberia SAP CX area. I apply architectural thinking and performance optimization principles from systems programming to enterprise solutions.

By night, I work on [**Another Dunkan Engine**](https://github.com/Dunkansdk/another-dunkan-engine)—a Vulkan-based game engine featuring:
- Custom ECS (Entity Component System)
- Deferred rendering with PBR (Physically Based Rendering)
- SSAO (Screen Space Ambient Occlusion)
- Modern C++20 architecture

#### Technical Journey

My programming journey started with **Visual Basic 6** modding **Argentum Online** (a 2D MMORPG), where I learned about networking, game loops, and real-time systems. This led me to:

- **C/C++ systems programming** - Building game engines, understanding memory layouts
- **Vulkan graphics API** - Low-level GPU programming, render pipelines
- **Assembly** - Reverse engineering and understanding how code really works
- **Enterprise architecture** - Applying performance principles at scale

#### Core Expertise

**Systems & Game Development:**
- C/C++ (Modern C++20), Vulkan API, OpenGL
- Game engine architecture, ECS patterns
- Graphics programming, shader development (GLSL)
- Visual Basic 6 (legacy game modding)
- Performance optimization, profiling

**Enterprise Architecture:**
- SAP Commerce Cloud, SAP BTP, S/4HANA
- Java, Spring Boot, Microservices
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure)
- AI/GenAI integration

#### Education

- **SAP Certified Associate** - Business User, SAP
- **Técnico Superior en Programación** - Universidad Tecnológica Nacional (2016-2018)
- **Self-taught** - Graphics programming, systems architecture, game engine development
